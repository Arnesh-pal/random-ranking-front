## ## Getting Started: Local Development Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### ### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* A free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) account.

### ### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the backend repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-backend-repo-url>
    cd user-ranking-backend
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the `user-ranking-backend` directory and add your MongoDB connection string:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/user-ranking-db?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ```

4.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    Your backend will be running on `http://localhost:5001`.

### ### Frontend Setup

1.  **Clone the frontend repository in a separate folder:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-frontend-repo-url>
    cd user-ranking-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Connect to the local backend:**
    Open `src/App.js` and ensure the `API_URL` is pointing to your local server:
    ```javascript
    const API_URL = 'http://localhost:5001';
    ```

4.  **Start the frontend application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Your React app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file in the backend directory:

* `MONGO_URI`: Your connection string from MongoDB Atlas.

When deploying, you will also need to set these on your hosting provider (Render):

* `MONGO_URI`: The same connection string.
* `FRONTEND_URL`: The live URL of your deployed Vercel frontend.
